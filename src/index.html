        <h2>A little about studio ghibli</h2>
        <p>
          Studio Ghibli Inc. is a Japanese animation film studio headquartered
          in Koganei, Tokyo. It is best known for its animated feature films,
          and has also produced several short subjects, television commercials,
          and one television film. Its mascot and most recognizable symbol is a
          character named Totoro, a giant catlike spirit from the 1988 anime
          film My Neighbor Totoro. Among the studio's highest-grossing films are
          Spirited Away (2001), Howl's Moving Castle (2004) and Ponyo (2008).
          The studio was founded on June 15, 1985 by directors Hayao Miyazaki
          and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after the successful
          performance of Topcraft's Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind (1984).
          It has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual
          development of several games.

          Five of the studio's films are among the ten highest-grossing anime
          feature films made in Japan. Spirited Away is second, grossing 31.68
          billion yen in Japan and over US$380 million worldwide; and Princess
          Mononoke is fourth, grossing 20.18 billion yen. Many of their works
          have won the Animage Grand Prix award. Four have won the Japan Academy
          Prize for Animation of the Year. Five of their films have received
          Academy Award nominations. Spirited Away won the 2002 Golden Bear and
          the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

          On August 3, 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily suspended production
          following Miyazaki's retirement. In February 2017, Suzuki announced
          that Miyazaki had come out of retirement to direct a new feature film,
          How Do You Live?, which he intended to be his last film.
